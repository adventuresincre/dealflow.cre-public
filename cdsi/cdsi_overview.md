# CRE Data Standards Initiative (CDSI)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **CRE Data Standards Initiative (CDSI)** is a collaborative project between the **A.CRE team ([AdventuresinCRE.com](https://www.adventuresincre.com))** and the **Pipe.CRE team**, aimed at **standardizing commercial real estate attributes** for use in frameworks, software, and AI agents.  

This initiative establishes a **structured and widely accepted set of attributes** that industry professionals can use for **deal tracking, underwriting, and investment analysis**.  

## ðŸ“‚ Where to Access CDSI Attributes
All CDSI attributes and protocols are maintained in a **publicly viewable Google Sheet**:  
ðŸ”— **[CDSI Attributes Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U7rQXOVtxO5o12A_n8ILGSXrY5R99MMpb8txbisstGc/edit?usp=sharing)**  

This sheet includes:
- **Standardized deal attributes**  
- **Property type classifications**  
- **Predefined attribute selections (e.g., `Deal_Status`)**  
- **Credits & license details**  

## âœ… How to Use CDSI Data
- **Developers & Analysts**: Use CDSI attributes as a standardized dataset for CRE applications.  
- **CRE Tech & AI Developers**: Implement these attributes into frameworks, software, and AI-driven tools.  
- **Industry Professionals**: Leverage CDSI for consistency in underwriting, comp analysis, and deal management.
